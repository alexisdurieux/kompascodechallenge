* To load the data I created a route that looks for 2 files to insert it
* About react-native:
  * It was the first time I used it, so I guess my code doesn't respect the best practices at all.
  * I had some issues for the bonus to load the data. The call was supposed to be on line 174 but it just displays a dash.
  * Also I did not manage to change screens with `navigator.push` so I had to use `navigator.replace`.
  * The send button just sends a post request and the node server responds a 200 status. So if the status code in the app is 200, I display an alert.

* Please let me know if you have any questions about my code: alexis.durieux94@gmail.com
